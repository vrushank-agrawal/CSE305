# CSE305 - Concurrent and Distributed Computing (2022-23)

This repo contains all 8 TDs and my project which I did with Nhat and Minjoo. 
I got 20/20 for all TDs except:
- TD3 for which I got 9/10 (I did not implement hierarchical locks and that resulted in race conditions when an account simultaneously tries to send and receive money)
- TD6 where I got 15/20 (I did not test my functions to obey parallelism because there were none provided and hence my code had plenty of bugs)

The project is available [here](https://github.com/nhat-vo/n-body-simulation) if the submodule link does not work.
